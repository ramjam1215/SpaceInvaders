# Last update to the project: 03-19-2018
- This was one of the most enlightening, albeit grueling, experiences of my very young programming career.
- Even as I wrote this, I was trying to think about how i can make the game more efficient.
- Down the stretch i really started to break some of our rules, mostly D.R.Y concepts, and adding too many conditionals.
- I completely understood when my professor, Edward Keenan, would say that they add more margin for error because our human logic is fallible. But, i digress.
 
# Existing Problems:
- 2 level limit,
- no 2 player,
- I used to have an issue with my splat animations(they had some issues with back pointers in the draw/render methods when i was "spamming" a lot of missiles,
when the aliens were close, and it needed to show a lot of the same animations at once). But, i haven't ran into the problem since my last changes yesterday.

# Proudest achievements
- I used a graveyard, but for some reason after the 2nd level i would lose a good chunk of my aliens,
which was really frustrating so i had to do a two level cut-off just for flow and presentation purposes.
 
- I helped a lot of my classmates with their projects; like Josh Glepko, Nivethan Sethupati, Luke Robbins, and Good ol' Chuck(Luke and Chuck were very helpful to me as well).
A lot of us including other classmates Gabriel and Matt were all in the lab bouncing ideas off each other. 
 
- I keep finding a lot of edge cases throughout my game with collisions and how their "re-actions" are processed; 
an example was my timer manager tried to remove the UFO sound event twice because it hit the wall and was shot. 
 
- I get into more detail about the design patterns in my video and paper.
- But thanks again to professor Keenan for all the knowledge, bread crumb trails, and the overall format of this class.
- This brought on alot of struggle and joy, but also gave me confidence and a much better work ethic.
- it has alot of work left unfinished, but i think that will be left for future projects to learn and fail at.
